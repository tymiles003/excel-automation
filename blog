Should you quit your job to start a business?

It is common to hear success stories of entrepreneurs becoming millionaires overnight. But what people don't tell you is the tireless 
nights, multiple failures and huge risks they took.

It is very rare to find successful entrepreneurs who suddenly decided to quit their job and start a business next day. Working for 
yourself requires a significant change in mindset from working as an employee to working as an entrepreneur.
