Should you quit your job to start a business?

It is common to hear success stories of entrepreneurs becoming millionaires overnight. But what people don't tell you is the tireless 
nights, multiple failures and huge risks they took.

It is very rare to find successful entrepreneurs who suddenly decided to quit their job and start a business next day. Working for 
yourself requires a significant change in mindset from working as an employee to working as an entrepreneur.

Speaking honestly there are lots of hurdles in starting a successful business. So it is better to prepare about the things than to get 
stuck and then start finding solutions.

Obvoiusly you can't plan everything, but you must consider a few points-
  1. Have you ever tested your business idea on real ground (on even small scale) ?
  2. Are you prepared financially to carry on your operations for the next 6 months or a year without revenue?
  3. What parameters will decide the success of your business?
  4. Do you have a plan to unfold your business in phases?
  5. What happens if the thinks are not working as expected and when to exit?
  
Now coming on the main point- When is the best time to start a business?

Starting a business is like having a kid. It never feels like the right time to do it.
